## About

**I have created this repo to help you understand how an efficient and simple token-based-login-system should work**

If you go through the code you will understand how to setup:
    reactjs, 
    redux and react-redux(for state management),
    jwt,
    axios,
    axios interceptors,
    error handling
and on the backend or server-side, you will know how to setup:
    nodejs,
    expressjs,
    cors,
    database queries and schemas(in this case mongo),
    endpoints,
    jwt,
    error handling,
    and maybe more.

If possible I might add some more things in the future.

**Please note that the CSS code is not going to be my focus in this repo.(You can contribute to css if you want)**
**If you come across an issue and know the fix, please contribute to the repo.**
**If you come across an issue and don't know how to fix it, feel free to get in touch.**
